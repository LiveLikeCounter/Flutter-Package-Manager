# 🎁 Flutter Christmas Packages App

A Flutter app based on a webapplication I made for a customer. My idea here is they can access the same data as in the webapplication just in a native app, made with Flutter :).

The purpose of this repo is to share the base of the app I made so far, so you can take advantage of it.

I have mainly focused on two parts now:
1. The design and pages
2. The (re)usalbility of the Drawer, Appbar and the Bottomnavigationbar*. I only made one drawer, appbar and bottomnavigation, which can be used through the whole app.
